# Safety analysis of the RustNethuns's socket model with the Miri interpreter

This repository contains a prototype of [RustNethuns](https://github.com/RiccardoSagramoni/rust-nethuns)'s sockets in order to assess the absence of Undefined Behavior due to the packet generation mechanism.

Refer to Chapter 6 of the [thesis](https://github.com/RiccardoSagramoni/rust-nethuns-thesis) for further details.
